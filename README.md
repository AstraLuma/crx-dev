These are some scripts to help with chrome extension development.

mkcrepo
-------
Reads a directory full of CRX files and produces the update manifest for it. Note that this doesn't change the CRX files at all, so they must already have the update URL.

git-crx
-------
(Incomplete) Produces a crx file from a git repository, rewriting the version based on git.
